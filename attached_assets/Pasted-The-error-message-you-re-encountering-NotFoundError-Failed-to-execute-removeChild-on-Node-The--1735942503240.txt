The error message you're encountering—NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node—typically arises when attempting to remove a DOM element that isn't a direct child of the specified parent. In React applications, this can occur due to issues with component rendering or improper DOM manipulations.

Potential Causes:

Incorrect Component Imports: Ensure that components are imported correctly, distinguishing between default and named exports. An incorrect import can lead to rendering issues, causing the application to attempt to manipulate non-existent DOM nodes.

Conditional Rendering Issues: If components are conditionally rendered, ensure that the conditions are managed properly to prevent React from attempting to remove components that aren't present in the DOM.

Third-Party Libraries: Some libraries may directly manipulate the DOM, leading to conflicts with React's virtual DOM. Ensure that any such libraries are compatible with React and are used appropriately.

Steps to Diagnose and Resolve:

Review Component Imports: Verify that all components are imported correctly in your admin.tsx file. Ensure that you're using the correct import syntax for default and named exports.

Check Conditional Rendering: Examine any conditional rendering logic in your components to ensure that React's rendering behavior aligns with your expectations.

Inspect Third-Party Library Usage: If you're using libraries that manipulate the DOM, review their integration to ensure they don't interfere with React's rendering process.

Update Dependencies: Ensure that all your project dependencies are up to date, as outdated packages can sometimes cause unexpected errors.

Consult Documentation and Community Resources: Refer to the official React and Decap CMS documentation for guidance. Additionally, consider searching for similar issues in community forums or GitHub repositories to see how others have resolved similar problems.

By systematically reviewing these aspects of your codebase, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the removeChild error.
